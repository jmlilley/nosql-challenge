Module 12 Homework

For this homework, the first part required you to import a json file and create a database and collection.

For the second part, you had to update the database with a new entry and change the variable type for some of the variables.

The last part of the homework was an exploratory analysis that required you to run a handful of queries to search the database and return the results.
